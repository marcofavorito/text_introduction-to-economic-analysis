    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch12_s02_p06">An increase in both prices by the same proportional factor has an effect identical to a decrease in income. Thus, one of the three financial values—the two prices and income—is redundant. That is, we can trace out all of the possible budget lines with any two of the three parameters. This can prove useful. We can arbitrarily set <em class="emphasis">pX</em> to be the number one without affecting the generality of the analysis. When setting a price to one, that related good is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">numeraire</a><span class="glossdef">A good used as a reference good, so that prices are denominated in units of that good.</span></span>, and essentially all prices are denominated with respect to that one good.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch12_s02_p07">A real-world example of a numeraire occurred when the currency used was based on gold, so that the prices of other goods were denominated in terms of the value of gold.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch12_s02_p08">Money is not necessarily the only constraint on the consumption of goods that a consumer faces. Time can be equally important. One can own all of the compact disks in the world, but they are useless if one doesn’t actually have time to listen to them. Indeed, when we consider the supply of labor, time will be a major issue—supplying labor (working) uses up time that could be used to consume goods. In this case, there will be two kinds of budget constraints—a financial one and a temporal one. At a fixed wage, time and money translate directly into one another, and the existence of the time constraint won’t present significant challenges to the theory. The conventional way to handle the time constraint is to use, as a baseline, working “full out,” and then to view leisure as a good that is purchased at a price equal to the wage. Thus, if you earn $20 an hour, we would set your budget at $480 a day, reflecting 24 hours of work; but we would then permit you to buy leisure time, during which eating, sleeping, brushing your teeth, and every other nonwork activity could be accomplished at a price equal to $20 per hour.</p>
