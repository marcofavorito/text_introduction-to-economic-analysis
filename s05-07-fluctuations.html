Drops in output are clearly noticeable. The official recessions are also marked. There are three booms that lasted about a decade; these are the longest booms in U.S. history and much longer than booms ordinarily last. Prior to World War II, a normal boom lasted 2½ years and the longest boom was 4 years. Recessions have historically lasted for 1½ to 2 years, a pattern that continues. Indeed, the average recession since World War II has been shorter than the average recession prior to that time.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s07_p04">An important aspect of the business cycle is that many economic variables move together, or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">covary</a><span class="glossdef">To move together.</span></span>. Some economic variables vary less with the business cycle than others. Investment varies very strongly with the business cycle, while overall employment varies weakly. Interest rates, inflation, stock prices, unemployment, and many other variables also vary systematically over the business cycle. Recessions are clearly visible in the percentage of the population employed, as illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s07_f02">Figure 4.54 "Percentage of the population employed"</a></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s07_p05">Some economic variables are much more variable than others. For example, investment, durable goods purchases, and utilization of production capacity vary more dramatically over the business cycle than consumption and employment. <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s07_f03">Figure 4.55 "Industrial factory capacity utilization"</a> shows the percentage of industrial capacity utilized to produce manufactured goods. This series is more volatile than production itself and responds more strongly to economic conditions.</p>
