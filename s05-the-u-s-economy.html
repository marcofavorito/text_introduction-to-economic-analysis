The population is primarily white, with 12%–13% African American and 4% classified as other. These proportions are relatively stable over the century, with the white population falling from 89% to 83%. The census is thought to understate minority populations because of greater difficulties in contacting minorities.

When social security was created in 1935, the average American male lived to be slightly less than 60 years old.

The significant drop in life expectancy in 1918—to nearly 30 years old for nonwhites—is primarily a consequence of the great influenza, which killed about 2.5% of the people who contracted it and killed more Americans in 1918 than did World War I. The Great Depression (1929–1939) also reduced life expectancy. The steady increase in life expectancy is also visible, with white females now living 80 years on average.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s02_p01">Why are the Western nations rich and many other nations poor? What creates the wealth of the developed nations? Modern economic analysis attributes much of the growth of the United States and other developed nations to its educated workforce, and not to natural resources. Japan, with a relative scarcity of natural resources but a highly educated workforce, is substantially richer than Brazil, with its abundance of natural resources.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s02_p02">Just less than 85% of the U.S. population completes 12 years of schooling, not counting kindergarten. Not all of these students graduate from high school, but they spend 12 years in school. The proportion that completes only 5 or fewer years of elementary school has dropped from about one quarter of the population to a steady 1.6%. At least 4 years of university now represents a bit more than one quarter of the population, which is a dramatic increase, illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s02_f01">Figure 4.12 "Educational attainment in years (percentage of population)"</a>. Slightly fewer women (25% vs. 28%)complete 4 years of university, although women are more likely to complete 4 years of high school.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s02_p03">Graduation rates are somewhat below the number of years completed, so that slightly less than three quarters of the U.S. population actually obtain their high school degree. Of those obtaining a high school degree, nearly half obtain a university or college degree.</p>
    <div class="figure large editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s02_f02">
        <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 4.13</span> Graduation rates (percentages)</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s02_p04">There are several interesting things to see in <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s02_f02">Figure 4.13 "Graduation rates (percentages)"</a>. First, high school completion dropped significantly during World War II (1940–1945) but rebounded afterward. Second, after World War II, college graduation spiked when many U.S. soldiers were sent to university by the government under a program called the “GI Bill.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mcafee-fn04_002">The etymology of GI, as slang for U.S. soldiers, is disputed, with candidates including “Government Issue,” “General Infantry,” and “Galvanized Iron”—the latter a reference to trash cans that looked like German World War I artillery.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s02_p05">As the number of high school students rose, the portion of high school graduates going to university fell, meaning that a larger segment of the population became high school educated. This increase represents the creation of the U.S. middle class; previously, high school completion and university attendance was in large part a sign of wealth. The creation of a large segment of the population who graduated from high school but didn’t attend university led to a population with substantial skills and abilities but no inherited wealth and they became the middle class.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s02_p06">High school completion has been declining for 30 years. This is surprising given the high rate of financial return to education in the United States. Much of the reduction in completion can be attributed to an increase in General Education Development (GED) certification, which is a program that grants diplomas (often erroneously thought to be a “General Equivalent Degree”) after successfully passing examinations in five subject areas. Unfortunately, those people who obtain GED certification are not as successful as high school graduates, even marginal graduates, and indeed the GED certification does not seem to help students succeed, in comparison with high school graduation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mcafee-fn04_003">In performing this kind of analysis, economists are very concerned with adjusting for the type of person. Smarter people are more likely to graduate from high school, but one doesn’t automatically become smart by attending high school. Thus, care has been taken to hold constant innate abilities, measured by various measures like IQ scores and performance on tests, so that the comparison is between similar individuals, some of whom persevere to finish school, some of whom don’t. Indeed, some studies use identical twins.</span></p>

More women live alone than men, even though four times as many families with a single adult member are headed by women.

So-called land line telephones may start to fall as apartment dwellers, especially students, begin to rely exclusively on cell phones. Just under 99% of households have complete plumbing facilities (running water, bath or shower, flush toilet), up from 54.7% in 1940.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s03_p05">How much income do these households make? What is the distribution of income? One way of assessing the distribution is to use quintiles to measure dispersion. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">quintile</a><span class="glossdef">One fifth, or 20%, of a group.</span></span> is one fifth, or 20%, of a group.

            <li>About 60% of households live in single-family detached homes.</li>
            <li>Slightly less than 0.5% of the population is incarcerated in state and federal prisons. This represents a four-fold increase over 1925 to 1975.</li>
            <li>Ten percent of households do not have an automobile, and 97.6% have a telephone.</li>
            <li>Just under 99% of households have complete plumbing facilities (running water, bath or shower, flush toilet), up from 55% in 1940.</li>
            <li>A quintile (or fifth) is a group of size 20%.</li>
            <li>The earnings of the top quintile fell slightly until the late 1960s, when it began to rise. All other quintiles lost income share to the top quintile starting in the mid-1980s. Figures like these suggest that families are getting poorer, except for an elite few. However, families are getting richer, just not as fast as the top quintile.</li>
            <li>Just after World War II, African American families earned about 50% of white family income. This ratio has risen gradually, noticeably in the 1960s after the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</li>

            <li>Have prices actually risen? Economists generally agree that the meaning of “prices have risen” is that you would prefer past prices to current prices. What makes this challenging is that the set of available products change over time. Cars have gone up significantly in price but are also more reliable. Would you be better off with your current income in 1913 than today? You would be very rich with current average income in 1913 but would not have access to modern medicine, television, electronics, refrigeration, highways, and many other technologies. If you made $40,000 annually in 1913, how would you live and what would you buy? (Do some research.)</li>
            <li>Compare a $40,000 income in 1980 to the present. What differences are there in available products? In the quality of products? How rich does $40,000 make you in each time period? In which period would you choose to live, and why?</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s04_p01">We learned something about where we live and what we buy. Where do we get our income? Primarily, we earn by providing goods and services. Nationally, we produce about $11 trillion worth of goods and services. Broadly speaking, we spend that $11 trillion on personal consumption of goods and services, savings, and government. This, by the way, is often expressed as Y = C + I + G, which states that income (Y) is spent on consumption (C), investment (I, which comes from savings), and government (G). One can consume imports as well, so the short-term constraint looks like Y + M = C + I + G + X, where M is imports and X is exports.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s04_p02">How much does the United States produce? Economists measure output with the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gross domestic product (GDP)</a><span class="glossdef">The value of traded goods and services produced within the borders of the United States.</span></span>, which is the value of traded goods and services produced within the borders of the United States. GDP thus excludes output of Japanese factories owned by Americans but includes the output of U.S. factories owned by the Japanese.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s04_p03">Importantly, GDP excludes nontraded goods and services. Thus, unpaid housework is not included. If you clean your own home, and your neighbor cleans his or her home, the cleaning does not contribute to GDP. On the other hand, if you and your neighbor pay each other to clean each other’s homes, GDP goes up by the payments, even though the actual production of goods and services remains unchanged. Thus, GDP does not measure our total output as a nation, because it neglects unpaid services. Why does it neglect unpaid services? Primarily because we can’t readily measure them. Data on transactions are generated by tax information and reporting requirements imposed on businesses. For the same reason, GDP neglects illegal activities as well, such as illegal drug sales and pirated music sales. Thus, GDP is not a perfect measure of the production of our society. It is just the best measure we have.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s04_p04"><a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s04_f01">Figure 4.25 "Output, consumption, investment, and government"</a> shows the growth in GDP and its components of personal consumption, government expenditures, and investment. The figures are expressed in constant 1996 dollars—that is, adjusted for inflation. The figure for government includes the government’s purchases of goods and services—weapons, highways, rockets, pencils—but does not include transfer payments like social security and welfare programs. Transfer payments are excluded from this calculation because actual dollars are spent by the recipient, not by the government. The cost of making the transfer payments (e.g., printing and mailing the checks), however, is included in the cost of government.</p>

Contrary to many popular predictions, the prices of raw materials have fallen even as output and population have grown. We will see later in this book that the fall in prices of raw materials—ostensibly in fixed supply given the limited capacity of the earth—means that people expect a relative future abundance, either because of technological improvements in their use or because of large as yet undiscovered pools of the resources. An example of technological improvements is the substitution of fiber optic cable for copper wires. An enormous amount of copper has been recovered from telephone lines, and we can have more telephone lines and use less copper than was used in the past.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s04_p17">Manufacturing has become less important for several reasons. Many manufactured goods cost less, pulling down the overall value. In addition, we import more manufactured goods than in the past. We produce more services. T&amp;PU stands for transportation and public utilities, and includes electricity and telephone services and transportation including rail and air travel. This sector has shrunk as a portion of the entire economy, although the components have grown in absolute terms. For example, the number of airplane trips has grown dramatically, as illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s04_f08">Figure 4.32 "Air travel per capita"</a>.</p>

The overall participation rate has roughly tripled during the century and significantly exceeds the rate prevailing during World War II, when many women went to work. In addition, participation of married women has now risen above the level for unmarried women. The participation rate for single women is even higher, currently at 68%, and it is higher than the overall average participation rate of all residents. The difference is primarily elderly women, who are disproportionately more likely to be widowed rather than married or single, and who are less likely to be working.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s04_p24">Another sector of the economy that has been of focus in the news is national defense. How much do we spend on the military? In this century, the large expenditure occurred during World War II, when about 50% of GDP was spent by the government and 37% of GDP went to the armed forces. During the Korean War, we spent about 15% of GDP on military goods and less than 10% of GDP during the Vietnam War. The military buildup during Ronald Reagan’s presidency (1980–1988) increased our military expenditures from about 5.5% to 6.5% of GDP—a large percentage change in military expenditures, but a small diversion of GDP. The fall of the Soviet Union led the United States to reduce military expenditures, in what was called the “peace dividend,” but again the effects were modest, as illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s04_f14">Figure 4.38 "Defense as a percentage of GDP"</a>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s05_p01">With a budget over $2 trillion, the federal government represents just under 20% of the U.S. economy. It is one of the largest organizations in the world; only nations are larger organizations, and only a handful of nations are larger.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s05_p02">The size of the federal government, as a percentage of GDP, is shown in <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s05_f01">Figure 4.39 "Federal expenditures and revenues (percent of GDP)"</a>. Federal expenditures boomed during World War II (1940–1945), but shrank back to nearly prewar levels shortly afterward, with much of the difference attributable to veterans’ benefits and continuing international involvement. Federal expenditures, as a percentage of GDP, continued to grow until Ronald Reagan’s presidency in 1980, when they began to shrink slightly after an initial growth. <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s05_f01">Figure 4.39 "Federal expenditures and revenues (percent of GDP)"</a> also shows federal revenues, and the deficit—the difference between expenditures and revenues—is apparent, especially for World War II and 1970 to 1998.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s05_p03">Much has been written about the federal government’s “abdication” of various services, which are pushed onto state and local government. Usually this behavior is attributed to the Reagan presidency (1980–1988). There is some evidence of this behavior in the postwar data, but the effect is very modest and long term. Most of the growth in state and local government occurred between 1947 and 1970, well before the Reagan presidency; state and local government has been stable since then. Moreover, the expenditure of the federal government, which shows ups and downs, has also been fairly stable. In any event, such effects are modest overall.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s05_p05">A peculiarity of the U.S. federal government is a preference for “off-budget” expenditures.

Over time, however, off-budget items became a way of hiding the growth of government, through a process that became known as “smoke and mirrors.” The scope of these items is graphed in <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s05_f04">Figure 4.42 "Federal expenditures, on and off budget (% GDP)"</a>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s05_p09">A question you may ask, quite reasonably, is whether the social security program can survive to the time when you retire. A common misunderstanding about social security is that it is an investment program—that the taxes individuals pay in are invested and returned at retirement. As <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s05_f08">Figure 4.46 "Social security revenue and expenditure ($ millions)"</a> makes clear, for most of its existence the social security program has paid out approximately what it took in.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s05_p10">The social security administration has been ostensibly investing money and has a current value of approximately $1.5 trillion, which is a bit less than four times the current annual expenditure on social security. Unfortunately, this money is “invested” in the federal government, and thus is an obligation of the federal government, as opposed to an investment in the stock market. Consequently, from the perspective of someone who is hoping to retire in, say, 2050, this investment isn’t much comfort, since the investment won’t make it easier for the federal government to make the social security payments. The good news is that the government can print money. The bad news is that when the government prints a lot of money and the obligations of the social security administration are in the tens of trillions of dollars, it isn’t worth very much.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s05_p11">The federal government runs deficits, spending more than it earned. In most of the past 75 years, we see from <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s05_f01">Figure 4.39 "Federal expenditures and revenues (percent of GDP)"</a> that the government runs a deficit, bringing in less than it spends. Interest has been as high as 15% of the cost of the federal government (see <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s05_f06">Figure 4.44 "Major expenditures of the federal government"</a>). How large is the debt, and how serious is it? <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s05_f09">Figure 4.47 "Federal debt, total and percent of GDP"</a> gives the size of the federal debt in absolute dollars and as a percent of GDP. The debt was increased dramatically during World War II (1940–1945), but over the next 25 years little was added to it, so that as a portion of growing GDP, the debt fell.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s05_p12">Starting in the late 1970s, the United States began accumulating debt faster than it was growing, and the debt began to rise. That trend wasn’t stabilized until the 1990s, and then only because the economy grew at an extraordinary rate by historical standards. The expenditures following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, combined with a recession in the economy, have sent the debt rising dramatically, wiping out the reduction of the 1990s.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s05_p13">The national debt isn’t out of control, yet. At 4% interest rates on federal borrowing, we spend about 2.5% of GDP on interest servicing the federal debt. The right evaluation of the debt is as a percentage of GDP; viewed as a percentage, the size of the debt is of moderate size—serious but not critical. The serious side of the debt is the coming retirement of the baby boom generation, which is likely to put additional pressure on the government.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s05_p14">An important distinction in many economic activities is one between a stock and a flow.

Your bank account represents a stock of money; expenditures and income represent a flow. The national debt is a stock; the deficit is the addition to the debt and is a flow. If you think about a lake with incoming water and evaporation, the amount of water in the lake is the stock of water, while the incoming stream minus evaporation is the flow.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s05_p16">The National Science Foundation (NSF) provides funding for basic research. The general idea of government-funded research is that it is useful for ideas to be in the public domain and, moreover, that some research isn’t commercially viable but is valuable nevertheless. Studying asteroids and meteors produces little, if any, revenue but could, perhaps, save humanity one day in the event that we needed to deflect a large incoming asteroid. (Many scientists appear pessimistic about actually deflecting an asteroid.) Similarly, research into nuclear weapons might be commercially viable; but, as a society, we don’t want firms selling nuclear weapons to the highest bidder. In addition to the NSF, the National Institutes of Health, also a government agency, funds a great deal of research. How much does the government spend on research and development (R&amp;D)? <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s05_f10">Figure 4.48 "Federal spending on R&amp;D (% GDP)"</a> shows the history of R&amp;D expenditures. The 1960s “space race” competition between the United States and the Soviet Union led to the greatest federal expenditure on R&amp;D, and it topped 2% of GDP. There was a modest increase during the Reagan presidency (1980–1988) in defense R&amp;D, which promptly returned to earlier levels.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s05_p17">Where does the government get the money to buy all these things? As we see in <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s05_f11">Figure 4.49 "Sources of federal government revenue"</a>, the federal income tax currently produces just under 50% of federal revenue. Social security and Medicare taxes produce the next largest portion, with around 30%–35% of revenue. The rest comes from corporate profits’ taxes (about 10%), excise taxes like those imposed on liquor and cigarettes (under 5%), and other taxes like tariffs, fees, sales of property like radio spectrum and oil leases, and fines. The major change since World War II is the dramatic increase in social security, a consequence of the federal government’s attempt to ensure the future viability of the program, in the face of severely adverse demographics in the form of the retirement of the baby boom generation.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s05_p18">An important aspect of tax collection is that income taxes, like the federal income tax as well as social security and Medicare taxes, are very inexpensive to collect relative to sales taxes and excise taxes. Income taxes are straightforward to collect even relative to corporate income taxes. Quite reasonably, corporations can deduct expenses and the costs of doing business and are taxed on their profits, not on revenues. What is an allowable deduction, and what is not, makes corporate profits complicated to administer. Moreover, from an economic perspective, corporate taxes are paid by consumers in the form of higher prices for goods, at least when industries are competitive.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mcafee-ch04_s05_l02">
            <li>With a budget over $2 trillion, the federal government represents just under 20% of the U.S. economy.</li>
            <li>Federal employees include military personnel and the executive branch. State and local government employment is much larger than federal employment and has tripled in size since 1962.</li>
            <li>Transfers to individuals represent almost 50% of federal expenditures. Such transfers include social security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, and veteran’s benefits. Transfers are also known as entitlements, and other expenditures are called discretionary spending.</li>
            <li>The social security program has paid out approximately what it took in and is not an investment program.</li>
            <li>The federal government runs deficits, spending more than it earned. Starting in the late 1970s, the United States began accumulating debt faster than it was growing, and the debt began to rise. That trend wasn’t stabilized until the 1990s, and then only because the economy grew at an extraordinary rate by historical standards. The expenditures following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, combined with a recession in the economy, have sent the debt rising dramatically.</li>
            <li>The best way to evaluate the debt is as a percentage of GDP.</li>
            <li>An important distinction in many economic activities is one between a stock and a flow. Your bank account represents a stock of money; expenditures and income represent a flow. The national debt is a stock; the deficit is the addition to the debt and is a flow.</li>
            <li>Government funded research and development represents about 1% of GDP, divided about equally between military and civilian research.</li>
            <li>The federal income tax currently produces just under 50% of federal revenue. Social security and Medicare taxes produce the next largest portion, about one third of revenue. The rest comes from corporate profits’ taxes (about 10%) and excise taxes like those imposed on liquor and cigarettes (under 5%).</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch04_s06_p01">The United States is a major trading nation. <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s06_f01">Figure 4.50 "Total imports and exports as a proportion of GDP"</a> represents total U.S. imports and exports, including foreign investments and earnings (e.g., earnings from U.S.-owned foreign assets). As is clear from this figure, the net trade surplus ended in the 1970s, and the United States now runs substantial trade deficits, around 4% of the GDP. In addition, trade is increasingly important in the economy.</p>

When we think of trade, we tend to think of goods traded—American soybeans, movies and computers sold abroad, as well as automobiles, toys, shoes, and wine purchased from foreign countries. <a class="xref" href="#mcafee-ch04_s06_f02">Figure 4.51 "U.S. trade in goods and services"</a> shows the total trade in goods and services, as a percentage of U.S. GDP. These figures are surprisingly similar, which show that investments and earnings from investment are roughly balanced—the United States invests abroad to a similar extent as foreigners invest in the United States.</p>

The United States and Canada remain the top trading countries of all pairs of countries. Trade with Mexico has grown substantially since the enactment of the 1994 North American Free Trade Act (NAFTA), which extended the earlier U.S.–Canada agreement to include Mexico, and Mexico is the second largest trading partner of the United States. Together, the top 15 account for three quarters of U.S. foreign trade.</p>

Drops in output are clearly noticeable. The official recessions are also marked. There are three booms that lasted about a decade; these are the longest booms in U.S. history and much longer than booms ordinarily last. Prior to World War II, a normal boom lasted 2½ years and the longest boom was 4 years. Recessions have historically lasted for 1½ to 2 years, a pattern that continues. Indeed, the average recession since World War II has been shorter than the average recession prior to that time.</p>
