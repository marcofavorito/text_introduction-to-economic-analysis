    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch19_s01_p01">An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">agent</a><span class="glossdef">A person who works for, or on behalf of, another.</span></span> is a person who works for, or on behalf of, another. Thus, an employee is an agent of a company. But agency extends beyond employee relationships. Independent contractors are also agents. Advertising firms, lawyers, and accountants are agents of their clients. The CEO of a company is an agent of the board of directors of the company. A grocery store is an agent of the manufacturer of corn chips sold in the store. Thus, the agency relationship extends beyond the employee into many different economic relationships. The entity—person or corporation—on whose behalf an agent works is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">principal</a><span class="glossdef">The entity—person or corporation—on whose behalf an agent works.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch19_s01_p02">Agency theory is the study of incentives provided to agents. Incentives are an issue because agents need not have the same interests and goals as the principal. Employees spend billions of hours every year browsing the Web, e-mailing friends, and playing computer games while they are supposedly working. Attorneys hired to defend a corporation in a lawsuit have an incentive not to settle, to keep the billing flowing. (Such behavior would violate the attorneys’ ethics requirements.) Automobile repair shops have been known to use substandard or used replacement parts and bill for new, high-quality parts. These are all examples of a conflict in the incentives of the agent and the goals of the principal.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch19_s01_p03">Agency theory focuses on the cost of providing incentives. When you rent a car, an agency relationship is created. Even though a car rental company is called an agency, it is most useful to look at the renter as the agent because it is the renter’s behavior that is an issue. The company would like the agent to treat the car as if it were her own car. The renter, in contrast, knows it isn’t her own car and often drives accordingly.</p>

<span class="footnote" id="fwk-mcafee-fn19_001">P. J. O'Rourke, <em class="emphasis">Republican Party Reptile</em> (Boston: Atlantic Monthly, 1987), 242.</span>    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch19_s01_p05">How can the car rental company ensure that you don’t put its car into reverse while going forward at a high rate of speed? It could monitor your behavior, perhaps by putting a company representative in the car with you. That would be a very expensive and unpleasant solution to the problem of incentives. Instead, the company uses outcomes—if damage is done, the driver has to pay for it. That is also an imperfect solution because some drivers who abuse the cars get off scot-free, and others who don’t abuse the car still have cars that break down and are then mired in paperwork while they try to prove their good behavior. That is, a rule that penalizes drivers based on outcomes imposes risk on the drivers. Modern technology is improving monitoring with GPS tracking.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch19_s01_p06">To model the cost of provision of incentives, we consider an agent like a door-to-door encyclopedia salesperson. The agent will visit houses and sell encyclopedias to some proportion of the households; the more work the agent does, the more sales that are made. We let <em class="emphasis">x</em> represent the average dollar value of sales for a given level of effort; <em class="emphasis">x</em> is a choice the agent makes. However, <em class="emphasis">x</em> will come with risk to the agent, which we model using the variance δ<sup class="superscript">2</sup>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch19_s01_p07">The firm will pay the agent a share <em class="emphasis">s</em> of the money generated by the sales. In addition, the firm will pay the agent a salary <em class="emphasis">y</em>, which is fixed independently of sales. This scheme—a combination of salary and commission—covers many different situations. Real estate agents receive a mix of salary and commission. Authors receive an advance and a royalty, which works like a salary and commission.</p>
    <p class="para block" id="mcafee-ch19_s01_p08">The monetary compensation of the agent is <em class="emphasis">sx</em> + <em class="emphasis">y</em>. In addition, the agent has a cost of effort, which we take to be <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="mcafee_ch19_s01_m001" display="inline">

Finally, there is a cost of risk. The actual risk imposed on the agent is proportional to the degree he shares in the proceeds. If <em class="emphasis">s</em> is small, the agent faces almost no monetary risk, but if <em class="emphasis">s</em> is high, most of the risk is imposed on the agent. We use the linear cost of risk model, developed earlier, to impose a cost of risk, which is <em class="emphasis">s</em>λδ<sup class="superscript">2</sup>. Here, δ<sup class="superscript">2</sup> is the variance of the monetary risk, λ defines the agent’s attitude or cost of risk, and <em class="emphasis">s</em> is the share of the risk imposed on the agent. This results in a payoff to the agent of

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch19_s01_p09">The part of the equation represented by <em class="emphasis">sx</em> + <em class="emphasis">y</em> is the payments made to the agent.

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch19_s01_p10">The agency game works as follows. First, the principal offers a contract, which involves a commission <em class="emphasis">s</em> and a salary <em class="emphasis">y</em>. The agent can either accept or reject the contract and accepts if he obtains at least <em class="emphasis">u</em><sub class="subscript">0</sub> units of utility, the value of his next best offer.

    <p class="para editable block" id="mcafee-ch19_s01_p11">As with all subgame perfect equilibria, we work backward to first figure out what <em class="emphasis">x</em> an agent would choose.
